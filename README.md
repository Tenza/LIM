Lan Instant Messaging

###About

- This project was made in 2005 and it was developed in VB.NET using the IDE Visual Studio 2005, later upgraded to 2008, 2010 and 2012.
- The project, code and comments are in Portuguese, but there might be some inconsistencies.
- This was one of my first projects, and it was an attempt to clone the old MSN Messenger but only to work within a closed network.
- Please note that this project was made in 2005, my knowledge and programming skills have evolved since. So there might be bugs, code inconsistencies and overall wrong architectural decisions.
